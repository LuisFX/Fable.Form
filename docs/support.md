As the maintainer of Fable.Form, I am dedicated to helping the community and ensuring you get the most out of the project. Whether you're using Fable.Form for personal projects, internal tools, or a large-scale application, there are multiple support options available depending on your needs.

## 1. **Community Support**

You can get community support for Fable.Form through the following channels:

- [Fable.Form Github](https://github.com/MangelMaxime/Fable.Form) - Report issues, contribute code, or check out the latest updates.
- [F# Discord](https://discord.com/servers/fsharp-196693847965696000) - Join the conversation and ask questions directly in the Fable or web development channels.
- [F# Slack](https://fsharp.org/guides/slack/) - Another platform for real-time community discussions.

Support is offered by community members, including myself, based on availability and expertise. Feel free to ask questions, share your projects, and collaborate with other Fable.Form users. We encourage everyone to engage, contribute, and grow together as part of the Fable.Form community.

## 2. **Commercial Support**

For teams and organizations seeking dedicated and professional assistance, I propose a variety of commercial support options. Whether you need personalized help integrating Fable.Form into your workflow, developing custom components, or providing hands-on training, I’m here to assist.

### Available Services

- **Team Training**: Tailored sessions to help your team get up to speed with Fable.Form and F# development best practices. Whether you're new to functional programming or want to deepen your expertise, I can provide live sessions and workshop materials.

- **Custom Field Development**: If your project requires specific form fields or functionality that isn't covered by Fable.Form out of the box, I can develop custom fields to suit your needs.

- **CSS Framework Integration**: I can help you integrate Fable.Form with your preferred CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) to ensure a seamless design system and consistency throughout your forms.

### Why Choose Commercial Support?

- **Guaranteed Response Times**: Skip the wait and get immediate, high-priority support.
- **Tailored Solutions**: Receive help that’s specific to your project and business requirements.
- **Expert Guidance**: Leverage my deep knowledge of Fable.Form, F#, and web development.
